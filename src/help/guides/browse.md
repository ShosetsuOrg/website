# Browse

If you are here from in App, there can be 2 reasons.

- You clicked the button out of curiosity
- You do not see anything


## Curiosity

This is the browse view, Browse is a view that lists all extensions currently avalible on Shosetsu from the [repositories](/help/guides/repositories/).

## Nothing present

If you do not see any extensions, there are only a few things to do to get a full view.

First, try the simple refresh by either clicking refresh or pulling down to refresh.

If the above does not work, if you are living in India with BSNL or any other region that blocks github, please go to More>Repositories and add a new repository with the following URL.
```
https://repo.shosetsu.app/universe/
```
